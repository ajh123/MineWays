Add transportation stuff, for trains, for roads and more to Minecraft!

Curse Forge: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ttransportcraft
Wiki : https://github.com/ajh123/Transportation-Craft/wiki

Currently adds

Semaphore Signals = will stop trains when there are trains in the way

Led Signals = same as the Semaphore signals

Signal tuner = this will eventually open the settings UI for the signals 

 
There will eventually be vehicles such as Spacecraft, Aircraft, Road transport, Rail transport, Sea transport.
Also along with Spacecraft , the Space dimension will come along, with Aliens, even Planets that can be explored!

 
These signals will stop your trains from bouncing off each other when on the track.
Space will also give you loads of resources for building and who knows what!
 
 
This mod is currently in very early development, so expect bugs!
